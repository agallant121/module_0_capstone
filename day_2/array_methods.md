### Arrays
-The .sort method will give you a new array where the original elements or strings have been sorted into either ascending numerical order or alphabetically.
For example: a = [3, 2, 1]
             a.sort = [1, 2, 3]
-The .each method allows you to iterate through each element.
-The .join method will mush all of the elements in an array together.
    [1, 2, 3, 4].join becomes "1234"
-the .index method allows you to find the position for a specific element.
  a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] a.index("3") is 2.
-The .include? method will ask an array if an element is present. It will return a "true" or "false" response depending on if an element is present or not.
The .collect method creates a new array containing the values returned by the block.
-The .first and .last methods will return either the first or last element of an array.
-The .shuffle array will return an array with the elements shuffled from their original positions.
