## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

* They name blocks of code the same way you would use a variable to name a string. This way you can call upon the code without having to type it out every time.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello(my_name)

  puts "Hello #{my_name}."

end
puts hello("Sam I am")
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)

  puts "#{name} I am."

end
hello_someone("Sam")
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

* puts "#{name} I am.", after assigning the parameter a value.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
* Not so much a question I can articulate but I would still like to hear this explained out "for beginners" so to speak. I have looked at online videos and read explanations and I am definitely understanding it better but it would be helpful to hear/see an explanation of an example using our materials so we can compartmentalize a little better.
