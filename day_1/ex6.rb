# 2: I found 4 instances where strings were placed inside of strings.
# 3: I know this because these were strings that included variables that were assigned to stirngs.
# 4: It makes a longer string because each letter is a variable assigned to a string. So when the variables are added together so are their strings.
# 5: Both the ("") and ('') act in the same manner and will produce the same result for printing. There might be confusion when using them near conjuctive words like 'don't'' where an extra (') is needed.
